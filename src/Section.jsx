      <p><h3>About the course :</h3> React is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. It is maintained by Facebook and a large community of developers. Here's a detailed breakdown of the key concepts you'll learn in a React course:</p>
      <br></br>
      <p><h3>What we will learn :</h3>In a React course, you'll learn how to build dynamic and responsive user interfaces using a component-based architecture. You'll start by understanding React's core concepts, like JSX, components, props, and state, which allow you to create reusable and interactive UI elements. You'll dive into modern features like React Hooks, such as `useState` and `useEffect`, to manage state and side effects in functional components. The course will also cover advanced topics like routing with React Router, managing global state with Context API or Redux, and how to fetch data from APIs. Alongside these, you'll explore performance optimization techniques, testing with tools like Jest, and deploying React applications to production environments. By the end, you'll be able to build scalable, real-world web applications with React.</p>
